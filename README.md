### Hi there. I'm Dmitrij 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- :sparkler: I love to smooth Websites and Food :pretzel: 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Web Dev Skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS
-  :hammer_and_wrench: I'm want to learn React Native and Three.JS
- 😄 People think I'm a :bear: :honey_pot:


## Short Bio 

 - Chemistry (M.Sc) in Bio-Polymers 👨‍🔬 (2019)
 - Sales Manager 🏭 for Raw Materials 
 - decided to switch professions because apparently you can't have a mobile Laboratory 🤌
 

I absolutely fall in love with Web Development, thus pushing my skills on a Daily Basis. Currently, I have finished my **official React JS Certificate**.

## Future Skills
- Node JS with Express Libary
- React Native for Cross Plattform Development
- Three JS and WebGL because I love smooth animations and 3D Web 💪
